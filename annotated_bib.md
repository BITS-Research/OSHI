## Pearce, J. (2020). Distributed Manufacturing of Open-Source Medical Hardware for Pandemics. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202004.0054.v1</h2>
	
###Scope
This article lists the various initiatives that have started or can be improved in order to address the PPE hardware shortage for COVID-19. In this preprint, Pearce lists the possibilities in which manufacturing medical hardware needs to be changed and how they can be changed from "the traditional large-scale, centralized, long lead-time, forecast-driven production to a distributed manufacturing paradigm... [to] manufacturing [at] small-scale, decentralized, rapid, autonomous and geographically-proxemic to the consumer" specifically during times of crises and pandemics, such as COVID-19. With today's more accessible technology in open source releases and "self-replicating rapid prototyper class of 3-D printers", the dependency on the global supply chain can  be broken with the domestication of supply chain, addressing the distress of uncertainty in equipment needed during pandemics. Manufacturing behavior changes would be required to achieve FOSH (free and open source hardware) in order to be sustainable and scalable during pandemics. FOSH status levels can differ but are measured by: (1) accessibilty of designs (e.g. bill of materials (BOM), computer aided design (CAD), production files (STL files for 3-d printing), printed circuit boards (PCB) layouts, electronic files, "list of tools and production machines required, wiring diagrams, firmware and software, as well as assembly, operation and calibration". Pearce rates existing medical hardware needed to address COVID-19 pandemic needs by FOSH completed, FOSH with near full documentation, POS (i.e. partially open source), some open source tools available but primary plans are closed, and closed (i.e. no free/os alternatives). These are the hardware that Pearce evaluated and rated along the FOSH scale: ventilators, face shields, N95 masks, latex single use gloves, reusable vinyl/rubber gloves, eye protection (goggles), protective gowns (aprons), disposable thermometers, UV tube light for sterilization, medical masks (surgical/procedure), detergent/disinfectant, single use towels, biohazard bags, wheel chair, glucometer with strips, medicine, IV fluid -DNS/-Dextrose, and hard-frozen gel packs. In order for these medical hardware to grow towards FOSH, Pearce suggests a diversity of solutions: protecting Laboratories, MakerSpaces, and Fabrication Facilities During ‘Shelter in Place’; streamline and make more efficient the process of testing and approving medical hardware; develop a Good-Samaritan Law to protect makers and unintended consequences; and require all citizen funded research to be released under free and open source licenses.

### Purpose
Pearce makes a case as to why FOSH initiatives need to be taken seriously and can be tangibly addressed, in order to avoid distressing shortages in PPE during pandemics such as COVID-19.
	
### Methods
Pearce performed a systematic review of all documentation availabe per hardware and equipment type and rated each hardware's available documentation to FOSH standards.</p>
