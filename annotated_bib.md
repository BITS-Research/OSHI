## Pearce, J. (2020). Distributed Manufacturing of Open-Source Medical Hardware for Pandemics. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202004.0054.v1</h2>
	
###Scope
This article lists the various initiatives that have started or can be improved in order to address the PPE hardware shortage for COVID-19. In this preprint, Pearce lists the possibilities in which manufacturing medical hardware needs to be changed and how they can be changed from "the traditional large-scale, centralized, long lead-time, forecast-driven production to a distributed manufacturing paradigm... [to] manufacturing [at] small-scale, decentralized, rapid, autonomous and geographically-proxemic to the consumer" specifically during times of crises and pandemics, such as COVID-19. With today's more accessible technology in open source releases and "self-replicating rapid prototyper class of 3-D printers", the dependency on the global supply chain can  be broken with the domestication of supply chain, addressing the distress of uncertainty in equipment needed during pandemics. Manufacturing behavior changes would be required to achieve FOSH (free and open source hardware) in order to be sustainable and scalable during pandemics. FOSH status levels can differ but are measured by: (1) accessibilty of designs (e.g. bill of materials (BOM), computer aided design (CAD), production files (STL files for 3-d printing), printed circuit boards (PCB) layouts, electronic files, "list of tools and production machines required, wiring diagrams, firmware and software, as well as assembly, operation and calibration". Pearce rates existing medical hardware needed to address COVID-19 pandemic needs by FOSH completed, FOSH with near full documentation, POS (i.e. partially open source), some open source tools available but primary plans are closed, and closed (i.e. no free/os alternatives). These are the hardware that Pearce evaluated and rated along the FOSH scale: ventilators, face shields, N95 masks, latex single use gloves, reusable vinyl/rubber gloves, eye protection (goggles), protective gowns (aprons), disposable thermometers, UV tube light for sterilization, medical masks (surgical/procedure), detergent/disinfectant, single use towels, biohazard bags, wheel chair, glucometer with strips, medicine, IV fluid -DNS/-Dextrose, and hard-frozen gel packs. In order for these medical hardware to grow towards FOSH, Pearce suggests a diversity of solutions: protecting Laboratories, MakerSpaces, and Fabrication Facilities During ‘Shelter in Place’; streamline and make more efficient the process of testing and approving medical hardware; develop a Good-Samaritan Law to protect makers and unintended consequences; and require all citizen funded research to be released under free and open source licenses.

### Purpose
Pearce makes a case as to why FOSH initiatives need to be taken seriously and can be tangibly addressed, in order to avoid distressing shortages in PPE during pandemics such as COVID-19.
	
### Methods
Pearce performed a systematic review of all documentation availabe per hardware and equipment type and rated each hardware's available documentation to FOSH standards.</p>

### Scope
This article defines open source hardware by the various assets produced by open source hardware designers, their processes, and the intended use of the assets, in comparison to open source software outputs. By explaning the creators of open source hardware components (e.g. schematic capture program, netlist, and circuit board layout), the process to develop each component, and output and its use/non-use, Ackerman is clarifies when copyright or patent license language is appropriate for OSH protection. In the end, "electrons are cheap, but atoms are expensive", which further explains the nuance, limitations, and similarities to GPL that the OHL was published with. This article includes the history and explanation of the specificity of the OSH field, and closes with an Appendix of the full OHL which is owned by TAPR, but is openly available for any on to use for their OSH projects.

### Purpose
Ackerman was hired by TAPR, a non-profit "organization of amateur radio operators, advancing state of radio technology[... who] turn their project concepts into reproducible designs, and making these projects available as either kits or finished products to other amateurs", to help an informal group developers for high performance software defined radio products (HPSDR) "a license that would help them achieve their goal of building a Free-Software-like community of hardware developers protected from commercial expropriation." 

This article explains Ackerman's research in definin hardware and open hardwar compared to software and open software, in order to justify the theory and foundation to the Open Hardware License (OHL).

### Method
References to history of OSH and OSS, explanation of the OSH field and diagrams of the physical assets, and includes evidence from pre-existing legal cases to inform decision on copyright vs patent implemented on each OSH asset.

### Scope
This article is deeper reflection of developer, community, and company relations around OSH projects, in reaction to Makerbot closing source and development after 4 years of gaining popularity and gathering a deep and supportive community as an open source company. Through qualitative interviews, harvested data from 2 companies', with primary OSH products, community forums, and grounded theory, they were able to categorize the types of contributors (ranking from least to most innovative), types of contributions, leading to what makes it sustainable for the for-profit companies.
### Purpose
Li, et al., sought to understand 1) how the community contributes to the project; and 2) whether being firm-led and profit seeking eliminates the willingness of the community to participate. With the rise of OSH projects and the openness to OSH developers to allow others to make profit from their output, there is a need to understand how community continues to support or not support OSH-based companies.
### Method
Li, et al., interviewed founders from 30+ different OSH companies, harvested data from 2 OSH-based companies' community forums (as case studies), and grounded theory to come up with findings about engineer and customer communication behaviors..
